## Abstract

As city populations continue to grow, traffic congestion and rule violations pose significant challenges to road safety and efficiency. This project develops an AI-driven traffic management system utilizing YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to eliminate rule-breaking and enhance urban mobility. By integrating a Genetic Algorithm-optimized YOLOv5 model, the system achieves precise, real-time detection of traffic violations—such as helmet non-compliance among motorcyclists—while improving traffic flow and road safety. 

Key innovations include 5G and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications for instantaneous data sharing, IoT sensors and smart traffic lights for adaptive traffic control, and edge computing for rapid local processing of YOLOv5 outputs. Enhanced computer vision through YOLOv5 accurately identifies violations like failure to wear helmets or seatbelts, triggering automated fines logged securely via blockchain. 

Looking ahead, the project's roadmap incorporates augmented reality and drones to expand YOLOv5-based monitoring and enforcement, alongside quantum computing to optimize complex traffic simulations. This comprehensive YOLOv5-driven approach addresses current traffic challenges and establishes a scalable, sustainable foundation for smart city infrastructure, fostering a safer and more efficient transportation ecosystem.
